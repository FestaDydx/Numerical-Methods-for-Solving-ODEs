# Numerical-Methods-for-Solving-ODEs
Numerical Methods are employed to find numerical approximations to Ordinary Differential Equations. This file contains python codes for the implementation of the 
Euler's Method, 
Runge Kutta 2nd Order Method (i.e. Heun's, Midpoint, Ralston's Method), 
Runge Kutta 3rd Order Method, and 
Runge Kutta 4th Order Method.
