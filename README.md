# Numerical-Methods-for-Solving-ODEs
Numerical Methods are employed to find numerical approximations to Ordinary Differential Equations. This file contains python codes for the implementation of the following numerical methods;

1. Euler's Method, 

2. Runge Kutta 2nd Order Method (i.e. Heun's, Midpoint, Ralston's Method), 

3. Runge Kutta 3rd Order Method, and 

4. Runge Kutta 4th Order Method.
